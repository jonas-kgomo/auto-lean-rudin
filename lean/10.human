### Informal Explanation

#### Theorem

**(a) Archimedean Property:** If \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers and \( x > 0 \), then there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( nx > y \).

**(b) Density of Rational Numbers:** If \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers and \( x < y \), then there exists a rational number \( p \) such that \( x < p < y \).

**Proof**

**(a) Archimedean Property:**
1. Suppose for contradiction that there is no such positive integer \( n \). This means \( y \) is an upper bound for the set of \( nx \) where \( n \) runs through positive integers.
2. Let \(\alpha\) be the least upper bound (supremum) of this set.
3. Since \( x > 0 \), consider \( \alpha - x \), which is less than \( \alpha \).
4. By definition of supremum, \( \alpha - x \) should not be able to bound all \( nx \). Therefore, there must exist some \( m \) such that \( \alpha - x < mx \).
5. Adding \( x \) to both sides, we get \( \alpha < (m + 1)x \), which contradicts the fact that \(\alpha\) is an upper bound.

**(b) Density of Rational Numbers:**
1. Given \( x < y \), define \( d = y - x \), which is positive.
2. By applying part (a), we find a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n(y - x) > 1 \).
3. We can find integers \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) such that \( m_1 > nx \) and \( m_2 < nx \).
4. So there exists an integer \( m \) such that \( nx < m < nx + 1 \).
5. Dividing by \( n \), we get \( x < \frac{m}{n} < y \). So, \( p = \frac{m}{n} \) is the required rational number.
