The next theorem could be extracted from this construction with very little extra effort. However, we prefer to derive it from Theorem 1.19 since this provides a good illustration of what one can do with the least-upper-bound property.

### Theorem

* _If_ $x\in R$_,_ $y\in R$_, and_ $x>0$_, then there is a positive integer_ $n$ _such that_ $$nx>y.$$
* _If_ $x\in R$_,_ $y\in R$_, and_ $x<y$_, then there exists a_ $p\in Q$ _such that_ $x<p<y$_._

Part $(a)$ is usually referred to as the _archimedean property_ of $R$. Part $(b)$ may be stated by saying that $Q$ is _dense_ in $R$: Between any two real numbers there is a rational one.

**Proof**

* $(a)$ Let $A$ be the set of all $nx$, where $n$ runs through the positive integers. If $(a)$ were false, then $y$ would be an upper bound of $A$. But then $A$ has a _least_ upper bound in $R$. Put $\alpha=\sup A$. Since $x>0$, $\alpha-x<\alpha$, and $\alpha-x$ is not an upper bound of $A$. Hence $\alpha-x<mx$ for some positive integer $m$. But then $\alpha<(m+1)x\in A$, which is impossible, since $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $A$.
* $(b)$ Since $x<y$, we have $y-x>0$, and $(a)$ furnishes a positive integer $n$ such that $$n(y-x)>1.$$ Apply $(a)$ again, to obtain positive integers $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ such that $m_{1}>nx$, $m_{2}>-nx$. Then $$-m_{2}<nx<m_{1}.$$ Hence there is an integer $m$ (with $-m_{2}\leq m\leq m_{1}$) such that $$m-1\leq nx<m.$$ If we combine these inequalities, we obtain $$nx<m\leq 1+nx<ny.$$ Since $n>0$, it follows that $$x<\frac{m}{n}<y.$$ This proves $(b)$, with $p=m/n$.
