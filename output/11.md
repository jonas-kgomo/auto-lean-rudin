But $y-k<y$, which contradicts the fact that $y$ is the _least_ upper bound of $E$.

Hence $y^{n}=x$, and the proof is complete.

**Corollary** _If $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers and $n$ is a positive integer, then_

$$(ab)^{1/n}=a^{1/n}b^{1/n}.$$

**Proof** Put $\alpha=a^{1/n}$, $\beta=b^{1/n}$. Then

$$ab=\alpha^{n}\beta^{n}=(\alpha\beta)^{n},$$

since multiplication is commutative. [Axiom (M2) in Definition 1.12.] The uniqueness assertion of Theorem 1.21 shows therefore that

$$(ab)^{1/n}=\alpha\beta=a^{1/n}b^{1/n}.$$

**1.22**: DecimalsWe conclude this section by pointing out the relation between real numbers and decimals.

Let $x>0$ be real. Let $n_{0}$ be the largest integer such that $n_{0}\leq x$. (Note that the existence of $n_{0}$ depends on the archimedean property of $R$.) Having chosen $n_{0}$, $n_{1}$, $\ldots$, $n_{k-1}$, let $n_{k}$ be the largest integer such that

$$n_{0}+\frac{n_{1}}{10}+\,\cdots\,+\frac{n_{k}}{10^{k}}\leq x.$$

Let $E$ be the set of these numbers

$$n_{0}+\frac{n_{1}}{10}+\,\cdots\,+\frac{n_{k}}{10^{k}}\qquad(k=0,\,1,\,2,\ldots). \tag{5}$$

Then $x=\sup\,E$. The decimal expansion of $x$ is

$$n_{0}\cdot n_{1}n_{2}\,n_{3}\cdot\cdots. \tag{6}$$

Conversely, for any infinite decimal (6) the set $E$ of numbers (5) is bounded above, and (6) is the decimal expansion of $\sup\,E$.

Since we shall never use decimals, we do not enter into a detailed discussion.

## The Extended Real Number System

**1.23**: DefinitionThe extended real number system consists of the real field $R$ and two symbols, $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. We preserve the original order in $R$, and define

$$-\infty<x<+\infty$$

for every $x\in R$.
