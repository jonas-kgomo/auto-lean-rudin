**1.11**: **Theorem** _Suppose $S$ is an ordered set with the least-upper-bound property, $B\subset S$, $B$ is not empty, and $B$ is bounded below. Let $L$ be the set of all lower bounds of $B$. Then_

$$\alpha=\sup L$$

_exists in $S$, and $\alpha=\inf B$. In particular, $\inf B$ exists in $S$._

ProofSince $B$ is bounded below, $L$ is not empty. Since $L$ consists of exactly those $y\in S$ which satisfy the inequality $y\leq x$ for every $x\in B$, we see that _every $x\in B$ is an upper bound of $L$_. Thus $L$ is bounded above. Our hypothesis about $S$ implies therefore that $L$ has a supremum in $S$; call it $\alpha$.

If $\gamma<\alpha$ then (see Definition 1.8) $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $L$, hence $\gamma\notin B$. It follows that $\alpha\leq x$ for every $x\in B$. Thus $\alpha\in L$.

If $\alpha<\beta$ then $\beta\notin L$, since $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $L$.

We have shown that $\alpha\in L$ but $\beta\notin L$ if $\beta>\alpha$. In other words, $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $B$, but $\beta$ is not if $\beta>\alpha$. This means that $\alpha=\inf B$.

**FIELDS**

**1.12**: **Definition** A _field_ is a set $F$ with two operations, called _addition_ and _multiplication_, which satisfy the following so-called "field axioms" (A), (M), and (D):

**(A) Axioms for addition**

**(A1)**: If $x\in F$ and $y\in F$, then their sum $x+y$ is in $F$.
**(A2)**: Addition is commutative: $x+y=y+x$ for all $x$, $y\in F$.
**(A3)**: Addition is associative: $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$ for all $x$, $y$, $z\in F$.
**(A4)**: $F$ contains an element $0$ such that $0+x=x$ for every $x\in F$.
**(A5)**: To every $x\in F$ corresponds an element $-x\in F$ such that

$$x+(-x)=0.$$
**(M) Axioms for multiplication**

**(M1)**: If $x\in F$ and $y\in F$, then their product $xy$ is in $F$.
**(M2)**: Multiplication is commutative: $xy=yx$ for all $x$, $y\in F$.
**(M3)**: Multiplication is associative: $(xy)z=x(yz)$ for all $x$, $y$, $z\in F$.
**(M4)**: $F$ contains an element $1\neq 0$ such that $1x=x$ for every $x\in F$.
**(M5)**: If $x\in F$ and $x\neq 0$ then there exists an element $1/x\in F$ such that

$$x\cdot(1/x)=1.$$
