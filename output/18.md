can hold for any pair $\alpha$, $\beta$. To show that at least one holds, assume that the first two fail. Then $\alpha$ is not a subset of $\beta$. Hence there is a $p\in\alpha$ with $p\notin\beta$. If $q\in\beta$, it follows that $q<p$ (since $p\notin\beta$), hence $q\in\alpha$, by (II). Thus $\beta\subset\alpha$. Since $\beta\neq\alpha$, we conclude: $\beta<\alpha$. Thus $R$ is now an ordered set.

**Step 3**: _The ordered set $R$ has the least-upper-bound property._

To prove this, let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $R$, and assume that $\beta\in R$ is an upper bound of $A$. Define $\gamma$ to be the union of all $\alpha\in A$. In other words, $p\in\gamma$ if and only if $p\in\alpha$ for some $\alpha\in A$. We shall prove that $\gamma\in R$ and that $\gamma=\sup A$.

Since $A$ is not empty, there exists an $\alpha_{0}\in A$. This $\alpha_{0}$ is not empty. Since $\alpha_{0}\subset\gamma$, $\gamma$ is not empty. Next, $\gamma\subset\beta$ (since $\alpha\subset\beta$ for every $\alpha\in A$), and therefore $\gamma\neq Q$. Thus $\gamma$ satisfies property (I). To prove (II) and (III), pick $p\in\gamma$. Then $p\in\alpha_{1}$ for some $\alpha_{1}\in A$. If $q<p$, then $q\in\alpha_{1}$, hence $q\in\gamma$; this proves (II). If $r\in\alpha_{1}$ is so chosen that $r>p$, we see that $r\in\gamma$ (since $\alpha_{1}\subset\gamma$), and therefore $\gamma$ satisfies (III).

Thus $\gamma\in R$.

It is clear that $\alpha\leq\gamma$ for every $\alpha\in A$.

Suppose $\delta<\gamma$. Then there is an $s\in\gamma$ and that $s\notin\delta$. Since $s\in\gamma$, $s\in\alpha$ for some $\alpha\in A$. Hence $\delta<\alpha$, and $\delta$ is not an upper bound of $A$.

This gives the desired result: $\gamma=\sup A$.

**Step 4**: If $\alpha\in R$ and $\beta\in R$ we define $\alpha+\beta$ to be the set of all sums $r+s$, where $r\in\alpha$ and $s\in\beta$.

We define 0* to be the set of all negative rational numbers. It is clear that 0* is a cut. _We verify that the axioms for addition_ (see Definition 1.12) _hold in $R$, with 0* playing the role of $0$._

(A1) We have to show that $\alpha+\beta$ is a cut. It is clear that $\alpha+\beta$ is a nonempty subset of $Q$. Take $r^{\prime}\notin\alpha$, $s^{\prime}\notin\beta$. Then $r^{\prime}+s^{\prime}>r+s$ for all choices of $r\in\alpha$, $s\in\beta$. Thus $r^{\prime}+s^{\prime}\notin\alpha+\beta$. It follows that $\alpha+\beta$ has property (I).

Pick $p\in\alpha+\beta$. Then $p=r+s$, with $r\in\alpha$, $s\in\beta$. If $q<p$, then $q-s<r$, so $q-s\in\alpha$, and $q=(q-s)+s\in\alpha+\beta$. Thus (II) holds. Choose $t\in\alpha$ so that $t>r$. Then $p<t+s$ and $t+s\in\alpha+\beta$. Thus (III) holds.

(A2) $\alpha+\beta$ is the set of all $r+s$, with $r\in\alpha$, $s\in\beta$. By the same definition, $\beta+\alpha$ is the set of all $s+r$. Since $r+s=s+r$ for all $r\in Q$, $s\in Q$, we have $\alpha+\beta=\beta+\alpha$.

(A3) As above, this follows from the associative law in $Q$.

(A4) If $r\in\alpha$ and $s\in 0^{\star}$, then $r+s<r$, hence $r+s\in\alpha$. Thus $\alpha+0^{\star}\subset\alpha$. To obtain the opposite inclusion, pick $p\in\alpha$, and pick $r\in\alpha$, $r>p$. Then
