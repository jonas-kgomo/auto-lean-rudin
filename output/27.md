The set whose elements are the sets $E_{a}$ will be denoted by $\{E_{a}\}$. Instead of speaking of sets of sets, we shall sometimes speak of a collection of sets, or a family of sets.

The _union_ of the sets $E_{a}$ is defined to be the set $S$ such that $x\in S$ if and only if $x\in E_{a}$ for at least one $\alpha\in A$. We use the notation

$$S=\bigcup_{a\,\in\,A}E_{a}.$$

If $A$ consists of the integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, one usually writes

$$S=\bigcup_{m=1}^{n}E_{m}$$

or

$$S=E_{1}\cup E_{2}\cup\cdots\cup E_{n}.$$

If $A$ is the set of all positive integers, the usual notation is

$$S=\bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty}E_{m}.$$

The symbol $\infty$ in (4) merely indicates that the union of a _countable_ collection of sets is taken, and should not be confused with the symbols $+\infty$, $-\infty$, introduced in Definition 1.23.

The _intersection_ of the sets $E_{a}$ is defined to be the set $P$ such that $x\in P$ if and only if $x\in E_{a}$ for every $\alpha\in A$. We use the notation

$$P=\bigcap_{a\,\in\,A}E_{a},$$

or

$$P=\bigcap_{m=1}^{n}E_{m}=E_{1}\cap E_{2}\cap\cdots\cap E_{n},$$

or

$$P=\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty}E_{m},$$

as for unions. If $A\cap B$ is not empty, we say that $A$ and $B$_intersect_; otherwise they are _disjoint_.

### Examples

* Suppose $E_{1}$ consists of $1,\,2,\,3$ and $E_{2}$ consists of $2,\,3,\,4$. Then $E_{1}\cup E_{2}$ consists of $1,\,2,\,3,\,4$, whereas $E_{1}\cap E_{2}$ consists of $2,\,3$.
