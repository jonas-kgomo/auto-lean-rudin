_Then the axioms $(M)$ and $(D)$ of Definition 1.12 hold, with $R^{+}$ in place of $F$, and with $1^{*}$ in the role of $1$._

The proofs are so similar to the ones given in detail in Step 4 that we omit them.

Note, in particular, that the second requirement of Definition 1.17 holds: If $\alpha>0^{*}$ and $\beta>0^{*}$ then $\alpha\beta>0^{*}$.

Step 7We complete the definition of multiplication by setting $\alpha 0^{*}=0^{*}\alpha=0^{*}$, and by setting

$$\alpha\beta=\begin{cases}(-\alpha)(-\beta)&\text{if $\alpha<0^{*}$, $\beta<0^{*}$,}\\ -[(-\alpha)\beta]&\text{if $\alpha<0^{*}$, $\beta>0^{*}$,}\\ -[\alpha\cdot(-\beta)]&\text{if $\alpha>0^{*}$, $\beta<0^{*}$.}\end{cases}$$

The products on the right were defined in Step 6.

Having proved (in Step 6) that the axioms (M) hold in $R^{+}$, it is now perfectly simple to prove them in $R$, by repeated application of the identity $\gamma=-(-\gamma)$ which is part of Proposition 1.14. (See Step 5.)

The proof of the distributive law

$$\alpha(\beta+\gamma)=\alpha\beta+\alpha\gamma$$

breaks into cases. For instance, suppose $\alpha>0^{*}$, $\beta<0^{*}$, $\beta+\gamma>0^{*}$. Then $\gamma=(\beta+\gamma)+(-\beta)$, and (since we already know that the distributive law holds in $R^{+}$)

$$\alpha\gamma=\alpha(\beta+\gamma)+\alpha\cdot(-\beta).$$

But $\alpha\cdot(-\beta)=-(\alpha\beta)$. Thus

$$\alpha\beta+\alpha\gamma=\alpha(\beta+\gamma).$$

The other cases are handled in the same way.

_We have now completed the proof that $R$ is an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property._

Step 8We associate with each $r\in Q$ the set $r^{*}$ which consists of all $p\in Q$ such that $p<r$. It is clear that each $r^{*}$ is a cut; that is, $r^{*}\in R$. These cuts satisfy the following relations:

$(a)$$r^{*}+s^{*}=(r+s)^{*}$,

$(b)$$r^{*}s^{*}=(rs)^{*}$,

$(c)$$r^{*}<s^{*}$ _if and only if $r<s$._

To prove $(a)$, choose $p\in r^{*}+s^{*}$. Then $p=u+v$, where $u<r$, $v<s$. Hence $p<r+s$, which says that $p\in(r+s)^{*}$.
