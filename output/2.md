_Then there exists a point $x$ between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that_

$$f(\beta)=P(\beta)+\frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}\,(\beta-\alpha)^{n}. \tag{24}$$

For $n=1$, this is just the mean value theorem. In general, the theorem shows that $f$ can be approximated by a polynomial of degree $n-1$, and that (24) allows us to estimate the error, if we know bounds on $\left|f^{(n)}(x)\right|.$

**Proof** Let $M$ be the number defined by

$$f(\beta)=P(\beta)+M(\beta-\alpha)^{n} \tag{25}$$

and put

$$g(t)=f(t)-P(t)-M(t-\alpha)^{n}\qquad(a\leq t\leq b). \tag{26}$$

We have to show that $n!M=f^{(n)}(x)$ for some $x$ between $\alpha$ and $\beta$. By (23) and (26),

$$g^{(n)}(t)=f^{(n)}(t)-n!M\qquad(a<t<b). \tag{27}$$

Hence the proof will be complete if we can show that $g^{(n)}(x)=0$ for some $x$ between $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Since $P^{(k)}(\alpha)=f^{(k)}(\alpha)$ for $k=0$,..., $n-1$, we have

$$g(\alpha)=g^{\prime}(\alpha)=\cdots=g^{(n-1)}(\alpha)=0. \tag{28}$$

Our choice of $M$ shows that $g(\beta)=0$, so that $g^{\prime}(x_{1})=0$ for some $x_{1}$ between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, by the mean value theorem. Since $g^{\prime}(\alpha)=0$, we conclude similarly that $g^{\prime\prime}(x_{2})=0$ for some $x_{2}$ between $\alpha$ and $x_{1}$. After $n$ steps we arrive at the conclusion that $g^{(n)}(x_{n})=0$ for some $x_{n}$ between $\alpha$ and $x_{n-1}$, that is, between $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

16 **Remarks** Definition 5.1 applies without any change to complex functions $f$ defined on $[a,b]$, and Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, as well as their proofs, remain valid. If $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are the real and imaginary parts of $f$, that is, if

$$f(t)=f_{1}(t)+if_{2}(t)$$

for $a\leq t\leq b$, where $f_{1}(t)$ and $f_{2}(t)$ are real, then we clearly have

$$f^{\prime}(x)=f_{1}^{\prime}(x)+if_{2}^{\prime}(x); \tag{29}$$

also, $f$ is differentiable at $x$ if and only if both $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are differentiable at $x$.
