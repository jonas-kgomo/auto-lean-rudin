We shall now prove the existence of $n$th roots of positive reals. This proof will show how the difficulty pointed out in the Introduction (irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$) can be handled in $R$.

**1.21 Theorem**: _For every real $x>0$ and every integer $n>0$ there is one and only one positive real $y$ such that $y^{n}=x$._

This number $y$ is written $\sqrt[n]{x}$ or $x^{1/n}$.

**Proof** That there is at most one such $y$ is clear, since $0<y_{1}<y_{2}$ implies $y_{1}^{n}<y_{2}^{n}$.

Let $E$ be the set consisting of all positive real numbers $t$ such that $t^{n}<x$.

If $t=x/(1+x)$ then $0\leq t<1$. Hence $t^{n}\leq t<x$. Thus $t\in E$, and $E$ is not empty.

If $t>1+x$ then $t^{n}\geq t>x$, so that $t\notin E$. Thus $1+x$ is an upper bound of $E$.

Hence Theorem 1.19 implies the existence of

$$y=\sup\,E.$$

To prove that $y^{n}=x$ we will show that each of the inequalities $y^{n}<x$ and $y^{n}>x$ leads to a contradiction.

The identity $b^{n}-a^{n}=(b-a)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}a+\cdots+a^{n-1})$ yields the inequality

$$b^{n}-a^{n}<(b-a)nb^{n-1}$$

when $0<a<b$.

Assume $y^{n}<x$. Choose $h$ so that $0<h<1$ and

$$h<\frac{x-y^{n}}{n(y+1)^{n-1}}.$$

Put $a=y$, $b=y+h$. Then

$$(y+h)^{n}-y^{n}<hn(y+h)^{n-1}<hn(y+1)^{n-1}<x-y^{n}.$$

Thus $(y+h)^{n}<x$, and $y+h\in E$. Since $y+h>y$, this contradicts the fact that $y$ is an upper bound of $E$.

Assume $y^{n}>x$. Put

$$k=\frac{y^{n}-x}{ny^{n-1}}.$$

Then $0<k<y$. If $t\geq y-k$, we conclude that

$$y^{n}-t^{n}\leq y^{n}-(y-k)^{n}<kny^{n-1}=y^{n}-x.$$

Thus $t^{n}>x$, and $t\notin E$. It follows that $y-k$ is an upper bound of $E$
