$p-r\in 0^{*}$, and $p=r+(p-r)\in\alpha+0^{*}$. Thus $\alpha\subset\alpha+0^{*}$. We conclude that $\alpha+0^{*}=\alpha$.

Fix $\alpha\in R$. Let $\beta$ be the set of all $p$ with the following property:

_There exists $r>0$ such that $-p-r\notin\alpha$._

In other words, some rational number smaller than $-p$ fails to be in $\alpha$.

_We show that $\beta\in R$ and that $\alpha+\beta=0^{*}$._

If $s\notin\alpha$ and $p=-s-1$, then $-p-1\notin\alpha$, hence $p\in\beta$. So $\beta$ is not empty. If $q\in\alpha$, then $-q\notin\beta$. So $\beta\neq Q$. Hence $\beta$ satisfies (I).

Pick $p\in\beta$, and pick $r>0$, so that $-p-r\notin\alpha$. If $q<p$, then $-q-r>-p-r$, hence $-q-r\notin\alpha$. Thus $q\in\beta$, and (II) holds. Put $t=p+(r/2)$. Then $t>p$, and $-t-(r/2)=-p-r\notin\alpha$, so that $t\in\beta$. Hence $\beta$ satisfies (III).

We have proved that $\beta\in R$.

If $r\in\alpha$ and $s\in\beta$, then $-s\notin\alpha$, hence $r<-s$, $r+s<0$. Thus $\alpha+\beta=0^{*}$.

To prove the opposite inclusion, pick $v\in 0^{*}$, put $w=-v/2$. Then $w>0$, and there is an integer $n$ such that $nw\in\alpha$ but $(n+1)w\notin\alpha$. (Note that this depends on the fact that $Q$ has the archimedean property!) Put $p=-(n+2)w$. Then $p\in\beta$, since $-p-w\notin\alpha$, and

$$v=nw+p\in\alpha+\beta.$$

Thus $0^{*}\subset\alpha+\beta$.

We conclude that $\alpha+\beta=0^{*}$.

This $\beta$ will of course be denoted by $-\alpha$.

**Step 5** Having proved that the addition defined in Step 4 satisfies Axioms (A) of Definition 1.12, it follows that Proposition 1.14 is valid in $R$, and we can prove one of the requirements of Definition 1.17:

_If $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma\in R$ and $\beta<\gamma$, then $\alpha+\beta<\alpha+\gamma$._

Indeed, it is obvious from the definition of $+$ in $R$ that $\alpha+\beta\subset\alpha+\gamma$; if we had $\alpha+\beta=\alpha+\gamma$, the cancellation law (Proposition 1.14) would imply $\beta=\gamma$.

It also follows that $\alpha>0^{*}$ if and only if $-\alpha<0^{*}$.

**Step 6** Multiplication is a little more bothersome than addition in the present context, since products of negative rationals are positive. For this reason we confine ourselves first to $R^{+}$, the set of all $\alpha\in R$ with $\alpha>0^{*}$.

If $\alpha\in R^{+}$ and $\beta\in R^{+}$, we define $\alpha\beta$ to be the set of all $p$ such that $p\leq rs$ for some choice of $r\in\alpha$, $s\in\beta$, $r>0$, $s>0$.

We define $1^{*}$ to be the set of all $q<1$.
