### 2.1 Finite, Countable, and Uncountable Sets

We begin this section with a definition of the function concept.

#### 2.1.1 Definition

Consider two sets $A$ and $B$, whose elements may be any objects whatsoever, and suppose that with each element $x$ of $A$ there is associated, in some manner, an element of $B$, which we denote by $f(x)$. Then $f$ is said to be a _function_ from $A$ to $B$ (or a _mapping_ of $A$ into $B$). The set $A$ is called the _domain_ of $f$ (we also say $f$ is defined on $A$), and the elements $f(x)$ are called the _values_ of $f$. The set of all values of $f$ is called the _range_ of $f$.

#### 2.2.2 Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets and let $f$ be a mapping of $A$ into $B$. If $E\subset A,f(E)$ is defined to be the set of all elements $f(x)$, for $x\in E$. We call $f(E)$ the _image_ of $E$ under $f$. In this notation, $f(A)$ is the range of $f$. It is clear that $f(A)\subset B$. If $f(A)=B$, we say that $f$ maps $A$_onto_$B$. (Note that, according to this usage, _onto_ is more specific than _into_.)

If $E\subset B,f^{-1}(E)$ denotes the set of all $x\in A$ such that $f(x)\in E$. We call $f^{-1}$ ($E$) the _inverse image_ of $E$ under $f$. If $y\in B,f^{-1}(y)$ is the set of all $x\in A$
