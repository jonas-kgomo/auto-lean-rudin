### Definition

Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, $E\subset S$, and $E$ is bounded above. Suppose there exists an $\alpha\in S$ with the following properties:

* $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$.
* If $\gamma<\alpha$ then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$.

Then $\alpha$ is called the _least upper bound of $E$_ [that there is at most one such $\alpha$ is clear from (ii)] or the _supremum of $E$_, and we write

$$\alpha=\sup E.$$

The _greatest lower bound_, or _infimum_, of a set $E$ which is bounded below is defined in the same manner: The statement

$$\alpha=\inf E$$

means that $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and that no $\beta$ with $\beta>\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$.

### Examples

* Consider the sets $A$ and $B$ of Example 1.1 as subsets of the ordered set $Q$. The set $A$ is bounded above. In fact, the upper bounds of $A$ are exactly the members of $B$. Since $B$ contains no smallest member, $A$_has no least upper bound in $Q$_.

Similarly, $B$ is bounded below: The set of all lower bounds of $B$ consists of $A$ and of all $r\in Q$ with $r\leq 0$. Since $A$ has no lasgest member, $B$_has no greatest lower bound in $Q$_.
* If $\alpha=\sup E$ exists, then $\alpha$ may or may not be a member of $E$. For instance, let $E_{1}$ be the set of all $r\in Q$ with $r<0$. Let $E_{2}$ be the set of all $r\in Q$ with $r\leq 0$. Then $$\sup E_{1}=\sup E_{2}=0,$$ and $0\notin E_{1}$, $0\in E_{2}$.
* Let $E$ consist of all numbers $1/n$, where $n=1$, $2$, $3$, $\ldots$. Then $\sup E=1$, which is in $E$, and $\inf E=0$, which is not in $E$.

### Definition

An ordered set $S$ is said to have the _least-upper-bound property_ if the following is true:

* If $E\subset S$, $E$ is not empty, and $E$ is bounded above, then $\sup E$ exists in $S$. Example 1.9($a$) shows that $Q$ does not have the least-upper-bound property. We shall now show that there is a close relation between greatest lower bounds and least upper bounds, and that every ordered set with the least-upper-bound property also has the greatest-lower-bound property.
