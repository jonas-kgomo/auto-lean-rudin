$(b)$ Let $A$ be the set of real numbers $x$ such that $0<x\leq 1$. For every $x\in A$, let $E_{x}$ be the set of real numbers $y$ such that $0<y<x$. Then

$E_{x}\subset E_{x}$ if and only if $0<x\leq z\leq 1$;

$(ii)$$\bigcup\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}x\in A\\ x\in A\end{subarray}}E_{x}=E_{1}$;

$(iii)$$\bigcap\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}x\in A\end{subarray}}E_{x}$ is empty;

$(i)$ and $(ii)$ are clear. To prove $(iii)$, we note that for every $y>0$, $y\notin E_{x}$ if $x<y$. Hence $y\notin\bigcap_{x\neq A}E_{x}$.

#### Remarks

Many properties of unions and intersections are quite similar to those of sums and products; in fact, the words sum and product were sometimes used in this connection, and the symbols $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ were written in place of $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$.

The commutative and associative laws are trivial:

$$A\cup B=B\cup A; A\cap B=B\cap A.$$

$$(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C); (A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap(B\cap C).$$

Thus the omission of parentheses in $(3)$ and $(6)$ is justified.

The distributive law also holds:

$$A\cap(B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C).$$

To prove this, let the left and right members of $(10)$ be denoted by $E$ and $F$, respectively.

Suppose $x\in E$. Then $x\in A$ and $x\in B\cup C$, that is, $x\in B$ or $x\in C$ (possibly both). Hence $x\in A\cap B$ or $x\in A\cap C$, so that $x\in F$. Thus $E\subset F$.

Next, suppose $x\in F$. Then $x\in A\cap B$ or $x\in A\cap C$. That is, $x\in A$, and $x\in B\cup C$. Hence $x\in A\cap(B\cup C)$, so that $F\subset E$.

It follows that $E=F$.

We list a few more relations which are easily verified:

$$A\subset A\cup B,$$

$$A\cap B\subset A.$$

If $0$ denotes the empty set, then

$$A\cup 0=A, A\cap 0=0.$$

If $A\subset B$, then

$$A\cup B=B, A\cap B=A.$$
